{
Effective detection of software faults is an important activity of software development process. Software plays a vital role,it  tells a computer how to function.Without software, most computers would be useless. For example, a web browser is a software application that allows users to access the internet. . An operating system (OS) is also  a software program that serves as the interface between other applications and the hardware on a computer or mobile device.So software are very important in this modern world of computers.
So defect detection is an important activity during software development process.For a software development  project ,it is  highly desirable to reduce software defects.The main goal of building program patterns is to find software defects.We implemented deep learning models with different feature extraction techniques to detect the defects in dataset.
